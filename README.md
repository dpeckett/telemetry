# telemetry

Anonymized Telemetry API. Why write my own? Because OMG the existing projects in 
this space are an absolute cesspool of complexity and over-engineering.

## Opting Out

If you don't want to participate in the anomymized telemetry, you can opt out by 
setting the `DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variable.

```sh
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```
